Once upon a time, there was a woman named Mary who lived in a castle far, far
away.
The castle was isolated, with Mary only being able to see tall, bushy trees outside
of her window. She could hear animals and birds chirping around, but no other humans 
like herself. She doesn't know how or why she lives in this castle, but she wants
to try and get out of it.   

But, Mary isn't alone in her castle. Her mother, who is extremely controlling, lives 
with her and is the reason why Mary has never left the castle. But Mary had enough, and 
decided to sneak out of the castle at night when her mother was sleeping. When she walked
out of the castle, she saw an entire village of people looking happy and working together. 
She couldn't believe that everything that she ever wanted was right outside her home. 
She joined the village and lived happily ever after. 

Except it didn't last forever. After a few days, Mary's mother is worried and sent out a search
team for her daughter. One day, as Mary is enjoying a nice walk on the lake, she catches her 
mother in the corner of her eyes. 

Mary's mother rushes towards Mary, streching her arms to embrace her missing daughter. To her surprise,
however, Mary seems to be startled as she runs to the side of the railing. "Don't come any further or I
will jump into the water!" Mary shouts to her mother.
