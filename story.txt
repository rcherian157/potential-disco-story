Once upon a time, there was a woman named Mary who lived in a castle far, far
away.
The castle was isolated, with Mary only being able to see tall, bushy trees outside
of her window. She could hear animals and birds chirping around, but no other humans 
like herself. She doesn't know how or why she lives in this castle, but she wants
to try and get out of it.
